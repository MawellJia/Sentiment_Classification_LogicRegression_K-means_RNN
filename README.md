## Introduction
This is one of my assignments during my university education. This assignment aims for us to practice TF-IDF features, pre-trained word embedding features, logic regression, K-means, and recurrent neural
networks. There are three questions for this assignmnet, and I have answered all the questions and got a high score. I want to appreciate my teacher's efforts here, I can't learn so many things without you, thank you.
I uploaded this assignment mainly for my self-review so that I won't forget this knowledge. And it will be great if this assignment can help more people.

The three questions are mainly about:

1. Movie Review Sentiment Classification: Using the IMDb movie review dataset labeled as positive or negative, apply a logistic regression model for sentiment classification.
   This includes using TF-IDF features and pre-trained word embedding features.

2. Movie Review Clustering: Using the unlabeled IMDb movie review dataset, apply the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze the structure of the review text.

3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Name Generator: Develop an autoregressive RNN model to generate names based on previous characters.
